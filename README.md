# Hi there! 
I'm Josh, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

Through my 16 months of work experience and projects, I know Python, Rust, Javascript/Typescript, C#, C++, C, and Clojure.

I am currently seeking opportunities for internships/co-ops. If you're looking for a dedicated and motivated individual with a strong technical foundation, I'd love to connect and explore how my skills align with your organization's vision!

Thanks for visiting my Github profile. Feel free to explore my projects and don't hesitate to reach out for any further information or potential collaboration opportunities.
