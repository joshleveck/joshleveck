# 👋 Hello there! 
I'm Josh, a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

💻 Currently I'm working on: 
- A Micromouse project, where I'm exploring robotics, autonomous navigation, and firmware.
- Recreating Prettier, the popular code formatter, where I'm deepening my understanding of language parsing and code transformation techniques.

(both in Rust!)

⚙️ In addition to Rust, through other projects and my 12 months of work experience, I know Javascript/Typescript and React, C# .NET, C++, C, Clojure, and Python.

🔍 I am currently seeking opportunities for Winter 2024 internships/co-ops. If you're looking for a dedicated and motivated individual with a strong technical foundation, I'd love to connect and explore how my skills align with your organization's vision!

Thanks for visiting my Github profile. Feel free to explore my projects and don't hesitate to reach out for any further information or potential collaboration opportunities. Let's build amazing things together!
